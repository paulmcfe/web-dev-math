    <h1>A Brief History of Leading</h1>
    <article>
        <p>
            What is leading and how did it originate? Let’s take a look.
        </p>
        <h2>Origins in Metal Type</h2>
        <p>
            The term leading (pronounced “led-ing”) comes from the practice in hand‑set metal type of inserting thin
            strips of lead between lines of type to increase vertical spacing. Early printers in the 15th and 16th
            centuries adjusted spacing by eye, but as books became more complex, standardized lead strips—often 1pt,
            2pt, or more in thickness—were cut and cataloged for consistent use.
        </p>
        <h2>Refinements in Hot‑Metal and Mechanical Composition</h2>
        <p>
            With the advent of Linotype and Monotype machines in the late 19th century, leading remained integral.
            Operators specified extra space by selecting slugs—fixed metal spacers—much as they did in manual
            typesetting. This allowed for systematic control over readability and aesthetics, especially in newspaper
            columns and book interiors.
        </p>
        <h2>Phototypesetting and Analog Spacing</h2>
        <p>
            In the mid‑20th century, phototypesetting replaced metal. Type was exposed on film or paper, and leading was
            controlled by rotating a dial or entering numerical values, rather than physically inserting strips.
            Designers could preview tighter or looser spacing more quickly, and film fonts often included built‑in
            metrics suggesting a default leading of roughly 20% of the point size.
        </p>
        <h2>Digital Typography and CSS Line‑Height</h2>
        <p>
            With desktop publishing from the 1980s onward, leading migrated into software as a numerical “line spacing”
            value. Applications like Adobe InDesign and QuarkXPress let users set leading in points (e.g., 12pt text on
            14pt leading). On the web, CSS introduced the line-height property, enabling scalable, relative spacing
            (e.g., <code>line-height: 1.5</code>). Today, leading remains a vital tool for legibility, aesthetic
            balance, and establishing a document’s rhythm.
