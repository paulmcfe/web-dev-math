    <h1>A Brief History of Leading</h1>
    <article>
        <p>
            What is leading and how did it originate? Let’s take a look.
        </p>
        <p>
            The term <i>leading</i> (pronounced “LED-ing”) comes from the practice in hand‑set metal type of inserting
            thin
            strips of lead between lines of type to increase vertical spacing. Early printers in the 15th and 16th
            centuries adjusted spacing by eye, but as books became more complex, standardized lead strips—often 1pt,
            2pt, or more in thickness—were cut and cataloged for consistent use.
        </p>
        <p>
            With the advent of Linotype and Monotype machines in the late 19th century, leading remained integral.
            Operators specified extra space by selecting slugs—fixed metal spacers—much as they did in manual
            typesetting. This allowed for systematic control over readability and aesthetics, especially in newspaper
            columns and book interiors.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the mid‑20th century, phototypesetting replaced metal. Type was exposed on film or paper, and leading was
            controlled by rotating a dial or entering numerical values, rather than physically inserting strips.
            Designers could preview tighter or looser spacing more quickly, and film fonts often included built‑in
            metrics suggesting a default leading of roughly 20% of the point size.
        </p>
        <p>
            With desktop publishing from the 1980s onward, leading migrated into software as a numerical “line spacing”
            value. Applications like Adobe InDesign and QuarkXPress let users set leading in points (e.g., 12pt text on
            14pt leading). On the web, CSS introduced the <code>line-height</code> property, enabling scalable, relative
            spacing
            (e.g., <code>line-height: 1.5</code>). Today, leading remains a vital tool for legibility, aesthetic
            balance, and establishing a document’s rhythm.
